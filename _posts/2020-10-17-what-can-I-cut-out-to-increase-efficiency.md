### More 20%, Less 80%

Each of us has an opportunity to achieve either the same with less effort or more from the same effort.  We can find and focus on increasing the (__20%__) activities that give us great results (__80%__).  To do more of the __20%__, we need to free up time in our schedule.

This is a very difficult question to answer.  I want to go back in time when I was running my own business or when I was working as the number two guy in the acquiring company.  I'm absolutely certain that knowing and implementing this principle would have yielded great benefits.  

Today, I'm primary caregiver and care coordinator for my father who has dementia.  Serving him in his current state requires the ministry of presence.  Even when there seems to be bits of time available to do other things, I need to focus on him.

Already, since taking my dad in, I've cut away a consulting gig that wasn't needed for money.  It was a false calling.  I don't need to prove myself in the business world.  If additional success comes in business, it will be in pursuit of the specifics of my calling which relates to mentoring.  All you can take with you is your relationships with other eternal creatures and the love and service to them which you performed.

More recently, I realized that I should cram all of my apartment complex bookkeeping, accounting, and management into one or two days per month.  For example, the sixth of the month is perfect for closing the prior month.  I decided I can let other bills and mail and inquiries stack up to be tackled on that day.

So, what do I cut?

### Conclusion:  Sleep earlier

To gain efficiency, given my current schedule, I need to go to bed earlier and then get up earlier.  I want to spend more quality time with God in the morning.  I want to think through more thoroughly how best to use the couple of hours I may have in a given day.  It all starts by starting better.
