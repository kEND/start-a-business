### and Why?

To answer this, we must first recognize how we are going to measure productivity.

During this season of life, my primary calling is coordinating the caregiving for my father and providing that care for over 38 hours in a given week. His state of mind is somewhat a measure of how well I do, but with dementia, it is really out of my control. Have I been loving? Have I been gentle? Have I been patient? All these questions asked with respect to him.

The other relational areas of my life—my spouse, my children, my peer disciples, my friends outside of the body of Christ—are measured by frequency, consistency, and depth of interaction with each person.

The remainder of what I do could be categorized as routine important bookkeeping, accounting, and managing of household and real estate. Productivity here is best measured by how many chunks of time are used in a month. For example several months ago, I would pay bills when they came in and engage in business as it came up. Now after making these changes already, I focus on one main day on the sixth of the month for real estate management with one partial day two weeks later for the same. Perhaps for our household financial work, I could become more efficient by doing it on the third or fourth of the month in a similar chunk.

The priority for a real impact in productivity as defined above, though, would be to allow myself the freedom to just be with my dad and not try to do multiple things at the same time. I’m often tempted to use time with him to be in his presence but also to get a few things done here and there, read a book, read an article, pay a bill, etc. Making more of the time that I have with him is truly a ministry of presence.  Doing so may have more of an impact on him (and on me).

For the second main area of productivity, there may be a few actions I can take to make time with my family, peers, and friends more impactful in their lives for eternity and for their time here on earth. This starts with more time to pray. Talking with God about each of these precious people can lead me to a point where I will listen to the Holy Spirit as He guides me in how I can best love and serve each of them in the time I have with them.

So, I need to wake up earlier. In order to wake up earlier, I need to sleep better. In order to sleep better, I need to reduce the sugar and caffeine that I consume daily.

### Conclusion

I need to reduce my caffeinated cola drinking down to one per day on the way to zero per day. I then need to get to bed five nights a week before 11 PM and wake up an hour earlier. This additional hour will help me pray for my friends and family and recognize the truth, that I am connected to God through the shed blood of Jesus and that he wants to work through me into their lives with loving service today!
