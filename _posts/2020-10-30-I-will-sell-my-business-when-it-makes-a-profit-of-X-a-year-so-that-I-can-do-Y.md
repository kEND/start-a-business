### The Past versus The Future

This is an interesting question.  Much of the lessons from this week's reading resonate because I was fortunate enough to have done this whether by intention or by accident.  I read ___Millionaire Next Door___ when it came out.  My wife and I were both, independently, learning about and trying to start our own network marketing businesses.  This book was part of the recommended monthly reading.

So, was I more influenced by the book or was it just confirming of my tendencies and encouraging me to continue to think and act differently from others?  Hard to say.

My most successful business was started as a lifestyle business.  We didn't start with a goal of selling at a certain point.  I knew nothing of the calling in the well-defined sense.  We saw a need that we could fill and decided to take the plunge.  Serving our clients well and being honest with them and our employees were always key principles in how we ran the business.  

We sold after six years when a buyer came along and offered us roughly 10X our annual profits.  They were billionaires and want to create a bigger global company quickly.  The price they paid was small to them and big to us.

After working through the earn-out period, I transitioned to an international student ministry to work as their COO.  This was essentially pro bono work with a goal of streamlining their operations, setting the stage to grow the ministry in terms of numbers of students served and number of health local ministries following the program.  

So, to answer the question directly using The Past, I sold my business when someone paid us 10X of profits.  We sold because we could and, in doing so, I concluded that I didn't need to dive back into the business world.  We have a heart for international students and missions in general.  The move to a COO role for a non-profit fit that heart.  Mission accomplished after four years in that role.  What's next?

### Conclusion

As to The Future, if or when I start another business, the goal will be not to sell.  Or perhaps to sell it to the best suited succession candidate.  We're planning to lay in a couple thousand dollars per month of additional income from rentals so we can move overseas to do BAM, business as a mission.  By starting a software consultancy in a foreign country, we can benefit the workers and clients while giving my wife and me the freedom to live in that country and work in member care serving foreign missionary families.
