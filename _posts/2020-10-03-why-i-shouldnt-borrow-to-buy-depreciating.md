## What is an asset?

An asset is anything in which you can invest capital that produces a return on that capital.  For our thinking, we consider the house we own to __not__ be an asset because we pay money for the house to provide for our need of shelter.  Conversely, a house purchased for rent, is an asset.

## Cost of borrowing

Think about it from the lender's perspective.  You're asking them to give up access to the their capital; to forego other opportunities to invest their capital; to take on risk--all for a period of time.  They expect compensation for each of these.  So, therefore you will pay more if you borrow than if you pay cash.

## Depreciation

The best example of this is a new car (or even a used one).  You consider purchasing a car because it will provide you with transportation.  It can be a necessary tool for your job or business.  But, cars depreciate and do so rapidly.  A $25,000 car may depreciate $3,000 immediately when you drive off the lot.  Imagine if you borrow money to buy this car.  You'll end up owing more than the car is worth.

## Power of compounding

The core tenant of The Richest Man in Babylon is to develop the self-discipline to save money and invest it with profits reinvested.  This harnesses the power of compounding on your behalf.  Borrowing to buy things that you consume (that depreciate) puts you on the wrong side of this same dynamic.
