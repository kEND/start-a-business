> I have a calling to start and run a foreign-based software development consultancy as a two-fold mission:  to bring the transforming life of Jesus into the lives of young, local software developers and their families, and; to provide regionally local member care for foreign-based missionaires and their families.

## The concept of seasons

We're in a season.  By the grace of God and supplied by his generous blessings, we are able to care for my dad who lives with us.  He is 81 years old and has dementia.  He's lived here a year and he'll live here until ...

Julie and I identified three seasons:

### Season One

Our current season.  Caregiving is primary.  Preparing for season two and three is secondary (or tertiary as Haven still lives with us).

### Season Two

The kids are out of the house.  Dad is dead or gone.  We have no day-to-day responsibility for our parents' lives.

### Season Three

This is the season where we live overseas ideally in a gateway city.  We don't know if God will open a door for this or if he will call us to go.  Preparing to go seems prudent and can serve the dual purpose of aiding our going and giving God some room to help us hear and understand his will with regard to living overseas.

## The calling (specifically my calling)

__My current calling is to be the care coordinator and caregiver for my elderly father__ who lives in our home.  This is the single most important thing I can do in which I'm most difficult to replace.  My responsibilities--as husband, father, home church leader, fellow brother in Christ, friend to my peers, steward of our finances--continue on.

The venn diagram below captures what Julie and I honed in on as a potential calling for the long haul.

  - __Mentoring Young People__

    When I look back on my death bed, I want to impact at least a few young people to the extent that they are strongly, faithfully following Jesus and pouring their lives into others who are doing the same.  I want to be known as someone who impacted more than a few young people if not so deeply, perhaps simply through helping them to make their lives on this earth better.

  - __Software Developers__

    I have experience that can be useful to those who want to become software developers for their career.  From source code management to project and product management to business and client perspective, I can coach a software developer or tech entrepreneur to become better at their occupation.  When I look back on my death bed, I want to impact a few software devs deeply, exposing them to the gospel, and being available to the Holy Spirit for use in winning them into the Kingdom.  Additionally, I want to be known as someone who gave his time to help other people succeed, even if in a narrow way by helping them succeed in their career.

  - __Gateway City__

    The Gateway City has:
      - language school
      - visa options / help with future visas
      - perhaps help starting businesses
      - help workers find local partners
      - unreached people groups
      - ...

    Well, the Gateway City....  For the purposes of this document, I'll use the vague notion that Julie and I have of what a Gateway City entails.  A Gateway city is a city relatively, regionally close to mission fields for unreached, unengaged, and underengaged people groups.  A mission organization can build up a missionary presence in a Gateway City to provide for oversight and member care that is much closer to the missionary families than heading back to their home countries on furlough.



    One vision we have is to be sent to fill a member care role in a Gateway City using Business As a Mission (BAM) as the reason for our visa and our presence.  One business I know how to run is a software consultancy.


> Bringing these three together, I have a calling, perhaps in the third season, to run a software development consultancy providing offshore project-based services to US companies.  This will be a Business As a Mission.  I'll be recruiting local university talent to work and learn in the company providing for their families.  I'll be bringing the life of Jesus into their lives and, by the grace of God, seeing them won into the Kingdom as solid disciples of Christ.  Likewise, Julie and I will be providing member care for missionaries and their families in the surrounding region.
