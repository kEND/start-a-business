### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 2: Before and After Brokenness

## Summarize

In this chapter, Nee simply expands on the prior chapter.  He identifies two states (apart from full brokkenness of the outward man) in which believers may find themselves when working for God.  First, is the unbrokenness of the outward man.  The flesh is the only way in which we can interact with other people.  Second, is the mixture of his spirit with the unbroken (or partially broken) self.

The key point to understand is that the Spirit gives life and the Spirit brings edification.  See John 6:63 and 2 Cor 3:6.  Our well-formed thoughts and heart-felt emotions and willing action, in the outward man, are in and of the flesh and not of the Spirit.  They, by definition, cannot bring life and edification to those in and out of the church.

Nee then writes two sections on examples that highlight and help us recognize the dynamic at play.

1.  Out-of-sync inward and outward man.
    
    Actively, outwardly trying to serve, bring a word, teach, or help a brother or sister in their walk and yet feeling rather innert inside.  Or conversely, having an abundance of significant inner thoughts and ideas for words and deeds that could help welling up in your spirit and yet there is no outward speach or action.

2.  Launching out and retreating.

    You find that you are able to engage the inner man in matters of import, but only by direct focus.  As soon as a distraction comes, you fall back to living in the flesh.  Or, you feel distant from God as you do mundane activities and have regular conversation with others.  You feel the need to withdraw to a quiet place to commune with God.
    
Both of these are captured in his analogy of being a "single" person versus a "dual" person.  The "single" person with intertwined soul an spirit is unable to remain in (or experience the) presence of God when they pursue mundane activities.  The "dual" person...

> is able to work with his outward man, while remaining constantly before God with his inward man.  Whenever the need arises, his inward man can break forth and manifest itself before others.  He enjoys the unbroke presence of God.

So then, in conclusion, "the ability to use our spirit depends upon the two-fold work of God:  The breaking of teh outward man.  And the dividing of spirit and soul--the separating of our inward man from the outward."

> First, the outward man is broken through __the discipline of the Holy Spirit__.  Second, the outward is divided from the inward man by __the revelation of the Holy Spirit__ (Heb 4:12).

## Impact

What is the impact of this chapter on me?

I know that I'm much more broken today than I was a year ago.  Praise be to God!  There seems to be more breaking and dividing needed.  Of the examples given in the chapter, I resonate most closely with the one who knows spiritual words and activities and does them out of the flesh while the spirit goes along for the ride.  It is no longer a strong resonance.  That said, I know God is bringing me close to being like Brother Lawrence, but his work is not yet done.
