### What future lifestyle?

I am almost 50.  At 70, I would like to be able to choose to continue in my calling or to move on to a secondary calling because the primary calling has been completed. 

Regarding lifestyle, my biggest hope is for physical and mental health so I can enjoy the meaningful relationships in my life. I’d like the freedom to be able to travel. To live where my wife and I can have the most impact for the kingdom. 

We are blessed currently to live in a home with no mortgage.   Our real estate holdings require some management, typically a couple full days per month max.  The recurring income provides 80-90% of our financial needs.  

By 70, I want more paid off real estate and a successful business started as a mission to reach indigenous communities by providing employment to them.  In this outcome, we’d be living overseas part time and in the states part time. 

Living on two continents part time each year will take more resources than we now have.  Beyond funding this opportunity, we have money for travel.  We have money for food and clothing and shelter.  We have transportation covered.  We give and want to give more.

### Conclusion

We’ve resisted the hedonistic ratchet to this point.  I expect a similar lifestyle in twenty years.
