### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 5: The Church and God's Work

## Summarize

Nee says:  God is considerably restricted in his work by the unbrokenness of man, the outward man.

His claim is:  First, God's work and power were limited to Jesus when he was here in the flesh.  Jesus didn't restrict God, he fully manifested God.  Second, in our day, God's work and power flows through the church.  Therefore, the church restricts God rather than manifesting Him to the world.  The degree of restriction is inverse to the degree of brokenness amoung the church.

This is a bold claim.  I'm not going to address it here.  Simply put, his claim makes me think and makes me wonder whether it is so.  Certainly in a localized manner, God is restricted.  He has chosen to use free-choosing agents to advance his plans.  Is this exclusive?  My gut says no, but we'll file this away for future research.  Nee uses a comparison between the gospels and the epistles.  

Given this view, Nee strongly advocates for embracing the discipline of the Holy Spirit in breaking the outward man so that the Spirit will be released and fully accomplish God's will in His power.  Without brokenness, the church cannot be a channel for God.

### How does the breaking of the outward man affect us?

1.  Reading the Bible.  

    We are to read the bible with "Biblical Thought".  Essentially he describes exegisis with a solid grammatical-historical hermeneutic.  When we can read the Word and understand the thoughts of the author and his intent, then we will know the true meaning of the Word. 

    We are also to read the bible with the Spirit.  The Spirit of the Word needs to be encountered and apprehended spiritually.  Intellect and emotions are okay, but we must go deeper into the gospel by the Spirit.

2.  Ministering the Word.

    God's life and His power via His Word comes through us to the other.  The members of the body often need an encounter with a spefic Word from God.  We must be broken so others can be served in this way.

3.  Preaching the Gospel.

    When the inward man, our spirit, flows forth and touches another person, the Holy Spirit interacts with their spirit.  He enlivens or quickens their spirit, making it more responsive to God.  The brokenness of our outward man is necessary to release our spirit to move in such a manner.  Doing this, we can bring the gospel of grace and the gospel of the kingdom to those in need in the body and outside of the body.

The breaking of the outward man is a necessity for these three things to occur.  If this doesn't happen fully or to a sufficient degree, Nee asserts that God will be restricted in his works and power.

> Lord, I put my all on your alter.  Cut a way through me so that the church may find a way.  I would not be one that blocks You and thus blocks the church.

## Impact

Nee is strongly advocating for many (or all) in the church to be broken in our outward man.  The strength of his assertion is not lost on me.  I'm uncertain about some of the nuances of his position, but locally in my life and in the body of believers around me, my lack of brokenness will directly impact how God works in our lives.  So, my choice to fully surrender to Him is a real choice and an important choice.

Father, you've helped me to turn to you and then to commit to following you.  You've helped me surrender more and more of my life over to you.  I know there is more that needs to be handed over to you.  Thank you for all that you have done and are doing.  Please have your way with me further so that the inward man, renewed to you, will flow forth to impact people lost in this world!
