### The Art of Persuasion

Well, Dr. North (or anyone else) would need to spend a little bit of time interacting with me to understand one or more of my primary wants at this point in my life.  Dale Carnegie (and Ben Franklin and countless others) would strongly recommend to Dr. North to avoid a direct negative confrontation wherein he tells me I'll fail or be less of a person if I don't tackle speed reading.

Through some observation, Dr. North would note that I subscribe to his site and have done so for many years.  He would also note that I have posted questions genuinely seeking answers.  These two traits alone may help him see, in me, a picture of someone who seeks non-mainstream counsel when presented with important life decisions.

Armed with this information, he could initiate a conversation with me with the intent of finding out what I really want to accomplish.  He would mention the traits of seeking counsel and showing a willingness to digest information that is contrarian.  In conversation, I would reveal that I'm close to being comfortable financially, with just a bit more work to do to finance my calling for the remainder of my life.  "What is your calling?" Dr. North would ask.

In answering this question, I would tell him about my desire to live overseas, operate a business as a means of advancing Christ's mission, while also providing local, regional support to missionary families.  Dr. North would affirm this calling as a worthy pursuit and would ask me a leading question, "How much do you need to learn about running a business in country X?  How much do you need to know to be an effective member care worker in a foreign mission organization?"

### Conclusion

"It sounds like you have a great opportunity to learn a ton about your host country, running a business there, and providing member care to missionaries.  The amount you need to learn may seem daunting, but the success of your business and mission are critical to the advancement of the gospel in country X."  

"Can I challenge you?"

"Yes," I would respond.

"Use Spreeder for 10 minutes per day.  Become even more educated.  Find materials relevant to living in country X, running a business there, and/or caring for missionary families."

"Use Spreeder for 10 minutes per day on these materials."

"I accept this challenge."

### In essence...

- Avoid negative verbal sanctions.
- Find what good traits the other person has, and mention them.
- Discover what someone wants, and intensify the desire.  
  - If there's a fit, show them how your product/service/ideas help him satisfy that desire.
