### The ads...

__The Touchstone__ statement answers these questions.

- What are you trying to sell me?
- How much?
- What's in it for me?
- Why should I believe you?

The _Irresistible Offer_ contains this touchstone with a high ROI offer for the buyer with believability.  So what?  Who says?

#### M & M's

You are trying to sell me chocolate candies that are not messy.  Price isn't mentioned.  It isn't really an issue.  WII-FM? Clean hands and great tasting chocolate.  This is beliveable because you showed me clean hands with M&M's and messy hands with other chocolate candies.  The High ROI is the clean hands.  I get to satisfy my chocolate craving without messing my hands.

#### American Express...

For the first portion of the ad, it is unclear what you are trying to sell me.  I ask how much because I don't relate with this man.  No answer.  What's in it for me?  I guess they're trying to sell style, status, and convience of their product.  Their card did come in handy for this guy, but so would have a roll of cash or a visa card.  (Maybe not in those days.)

The offer is unclear and it didn't answer the basic questions.  So what? No answer.  Who says?  American Express.  You've proven nothing to me.

#### The Commodore...

You are trying to sell me a computer for my home that can do what my computer at work does.  Clear price with added value.  What's in it for me?  I get the computer and the monitor and some software and I save almost $1000 dollars.  This is a high ROI offer.  Why should I believe you?  Well it runs all the major software and is expandable.  

I think this ad is good, but it is missing the high ROI for the buyer in terms of what the computer will actually do for me--the buyer.  They haven't proven it to me.

#### The TRS-80...

Brings the world of color computing into your home.

If I want this, it's a pretty decent opening line.  Benefits are then listed and there are many.  Perceived value increases.  This is a game system, an accounting system -- works for the whole family.  Price is clear.  High ROI because of all of those benefits.  

This ad answers the "So what?" question.  "Who says?"  Well, Radio Shack was a well known business.  It's expandable and programmable. 

### Conclusion

The M&M's ad and the TRS-80 ad are the two best ads of this bunch.  I'll tip the hat to the M&M ad for having a better touchstone statement.  The TRS-80's lead-in could be better.
