### The Breakthrough Principle of 16x

Richard Koch's book is really just a pamphlet.  He takes his principle to heart by not needlessly adding in a bunch of extraneous information.  The book is quick, clear, and to-the-point.

16x is, in essence, an application of Pareto's 20/80 principle from both sides of the equation.  If 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your clients and you serve your clients with equal effort, the effort you put into your top 20% of your clients yields 16 times better results than the effort spent on the bottom 80% of your clients.

There are a very few things that you do that yield fantastic results.  Find them, focus on them, do more of them by cutting away the many things that give you no or poor results.

The book identifies the principle, as above, using a sales example.  Then five practices are given to the reader to bring the 16x principle to bear in their life.

### Conclusion:  Cut and Create Space to Think!

Two areas comprise the most impactful 20% of the book for me:  the math example and the need to create space to think.

I've read enough and experienced enough to know that Pareto holds true, but the 16 times impact blew my mind.  I realized that I've never really applied the 20/80 principle rigorously to any area of my life.  The logic behind the 16x principle is solid.  Major change __can__ be had.

Applying the principle requires you to find your strengths.  Focus on what works fantastically well.  Cut the rest.  Cut the routine to create space.  Space to think.  Really think.

I'm convicted that I often gravitate toward doing the routine.  This is an opportunity to make regularly thinking about the most important things, a habit.
