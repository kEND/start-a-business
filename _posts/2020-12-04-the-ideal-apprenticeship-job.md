### The ideal apprenticeship job

The ideal apprenticeship job a sole-proprietor who runs a service based company with himself and a few other employees.  For example, an established custom welding company.

You want to find a true apprenticeship, where the owner will include you in many aspects of the business from marketing and sales to production and customer service.  Ideally you can also be exposed to the financial decisions and bookkeeping at some level.

Having a few additional employees indicates that the owner has likely satisfied customers well enough to grow a bit and sustain a business.  Other employees also indicate that he has learned how to help other people succeed as part of the business.

### Why seek an apprenticeship like this?

First and foremost, the smaller the company, the better.  You want to be exposed to as much as possible.  If this is as service oriented business centered around a set of skills, you will start to learn those skills.  You will learn the __value__ of those skills.  Second, you want to observe the owner interacting with potential customers and customers throughout the delivery cycle.  How does he bring in new business?  How does he price his service?  How does he communicate during the job and after delivery?  How does he handle custom service issues?

### Conclusion

An apprenticeship is an excellent way to learn very valuable skills quickly.  Learning from books and videos and podcast is important, but nothing really replaces the intense learning one does when tasked with doing something that they've never done before.

Try to find a sole-proprietor who runs a service business with several employees.  I like local service businesses, like plumbers and HVAC.  You'll learn a marketable skill and you'll learn about the business.
