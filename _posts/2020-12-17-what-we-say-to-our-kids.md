Have you recently read, watched, or heard something that made you stop and think?  Once you read it, etc., were you struck by the simplicity of the idea and how unfathomable it is that you weren't already talking about it and acting on it?

I recently had such an experience.  While watching a fascinating presentation by a Rabbi to a group of economists, I realized I've been believing one thing and telling my kids another.

### "Follow your heart!"

Parents, grandparents, teachers, guidance counselors--we all tend to say some form of this.  

Find your path.  Find you passion.  Do what you love.  You can be anything you set your mind on.  "Listen to your gut." says WebMD[^1]

I often stress to my kids that they look into certain education and work opportunities based on whether it will be a good decision.  For example, paying $80K to $120K for a sociology degree may not be wise if schools loans are involved and starting salaries are less than $40K per year.  I do want them to make wise decisions and I do want them to find their way in the world.

So what's wrong with this advice?

> The advice you sometimes get when you're graduating high school, when you're graduating college or at different stages of your life, people sometimes say to you, "the important thing in life is to find a job that you really love and go and work in an area that you've really got passion for."  Wrong.  It sounds very nice, but it's wrong! It's wrong because it is selfish.

### "Serve others."

The focus is entirely selfish.  We want what's best for our kids.  But, when we tell them these things, we reinforce what the world system constantly pours into their minds--serve yourself.  Rabbi Lapin says the morally right thing to do is to focus completely on __serving others__.  He continues...

>  This isn't about the money. It's about your relationship with other people.  You've got to find what
other people need and want and then learn how to get passionate about supplying it.  ___The passion follows what needs doing.___

### The Passion Follows What Needs Doing

When I heard this, it clicked.  I've been stressing the wrong things with my children!  Perhaps subtly (or perhaps not!), I've been pointing them in a self-focused direction.  

_Lord, please help me encourage my kids to think deeply about __serving others__.  Help me encourage them to ask You to help them see how they can serve other people--practically AND spiritually!_
