### My reasoning

I researched Wedgwood a bit.  I found out that there are really fantastically elegant patterns, e.g. with gold trim.  There are also patterns like the ones my wife wants to offload.  Why would someone want these?

The person who wants this set cares about hosting and presentation.  They are also refined enough to know that they don't want or need to over do it when hosting friends regularly.  Thus enters the Wedgwood bone china pattern you see above.  Using these cups and demitasse (half-plates) says, "I care about you, but we aren't hosting the Queen."

I included one picture because no one buys this stuff based on words alone.  OMG there are so many different patterns!

I'm offering free hand delivery to Central Ohio by a certain date.  I'm hoping this creates some urgency.  The action step is to email me.  My email address contains a tracking device so I can tell where they saw the ad.

### Conclusion

Ad writing is really difficult.  This could be much better.  I'm curious if it helps to care about the product.  In both cases, you need to take on the perspective of the potential buyer.
