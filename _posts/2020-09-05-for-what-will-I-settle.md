## With respect to [my calling]({% post_url 2020-08-30-my-calling %})...

> I have a calling to start and run a foreign-based software development consultancy as a two-fold mission:  to bring the transforming life of Jesus into the lives of young, local software developers and their families, and; to provide regionally local member care for foreign-based missionaries and their families.

### What am I willing to settle for having achieved one year from now?

Within one calendar year, I will write a draft business plan.  I will revise that plan twice through feedback from two experts in the field.  Additionally, I will draft a mission proposal and seek feedback from a mission sending organization, specifically from two individuals who already work for a particular organization.

### What am I willing to settle for having achieved five years from now?

Within five calendar years, I would settle for being in our destination city, in local language school, learning the city and the culture.  I would settle for having started our role of member care, having hosted several missionary families for regionally local respite.  I would settle for having three solid connections at the local university for identifying and placing excellent students with our consultancy.  I would settle for having three strong commitments from U.S. based companies to use our consultancy for project work.  I would settle for having identified one primary U.S. based technical leader to be my counterpart while I'm in country.

### What am I willing to settle for having achieved at age 70?

Within the next 20.5 calendar years, I would settle for looking into the eyes of some young folks and telling them that, with the Lord and their persistence (and persistence in prayer), they too can impact the lost for Jesus through a business run for profit, run ethically, run to impart the love of God on the workers in the business.  I would settle for knowing that at least one family of missionaries were able to stay on the field through the most difficult period of four to seven years so they could become fruitful in years eight to twenty.  I would settle for knowing that three software developers from our host nation turned their lives over to be led by Jesus _and_ that at least one of them was successfully discipling others of their countrymen in following Jesus.
