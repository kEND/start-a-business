### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 8: What Impression Do We Give?

## Summarize

Essentially, Nee highlights that when we act or when we speak, we also convey something mysterious.  This mysterious something brings forth an impression of us in the mind of the receiver.  This impression is often much more important than what we actually said or did, particularly if this impression is at odds with with what we said or did.

The impression we give is most frequently related to our strongest personality characteristic.  A needy-minded person may give the impression of helplessness.  A person determined to secure his identity in accomplishment will convey urgency and impatience.

We can leave a favorable impression from self, "but is God satisfied?" and is the body of Christ helped?  God's full intention requires a released spirit.  The released spirit will bring growth to the church.  Therefore the outward man must be broken!  Without breaking the spirit cannot come forth and our impression will not be spiritual.

We gain knowledge from solid teachings.  We actually "see the truth and enter into its reality" by the discipline of the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit works by breaking us down and building us up.  His enlightenment shines and fully reveals our true condition.  We are much, much more prideful and self-important than we realize.  His light reveals and our fleshliness is exposed and it withers away.

> As the Holy Spirit enlightens, so we are instantly dealt with.

Think Paul on the road to Damascus.  

When the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit strikes us, He does so with grace.  Not, "I'm a wretch.  God please save me!!"  Rather, "I'm a wretch.  God, I receive You!  I receive Your promised grace!  I am Yours!".  He wants us bare and naked before Him--His Word reveals the thoughts and intentions of the heart.  __He delivers us from self-centered bondage.__

Wow!  We are not truly free until He reveals this to us!

Can God be fully released through our spirit?  God is concerned about the impression we give.  What is coming forth from us?

Remain indwardly responsive to the Spirit's discipline and ready for his blazing light to reveal us.  Discipline is plentiful, but recognizing the hand of the Lord is rare.

## Impact

Lord, You are continuing Your amazing work in me!  You know that my outward man is still active and strong and You are determined to break it so You can be released through my spirit.  I do long for You to be glorified by a true spiritual impression coming forth from me by Your will.

Oh Lord, may You break me in my outward man!  May a life-giving impression accompany Your Word this Thursday!

My dominant characterist is black and white thinking and a desire to control or submit as a victim.  When I'm in this mindset, You are distant and cannot be trusted to help me.  

Yet, You are not distant!  You are sovereign, powerful, all knowing, and personal.  You have forgiven the one who wronged me and Jesus took on my shame and guilt on the cross.  There are many options.  It is not all or nothing.  Thank You Father!  Help me submit to Your loving and trustworthy hands in faith that You will bring forth all that care to in me and through me.  May my whole home church be impacted by You completing Your victory in me.
