## Or what did I give up to save > 10% after-tax?

Developing the self-discipline to save 10% or more of your after tax income is foundational.  Doing this prepares you to act on opportunities when you become aware of them.

My wife and I lived this out.  So rather than try to figure out a good answer from here, I'll tell you how we got here.  

### Where is here?

We own income producing real estate as the primary source of income for our household.  We have significant cash ready to deploy when opportunities present themselves (or we find them) in 2021 and beyond.  We got here by working hard and investing after laying in the self-discipline of saving through resistance to the ___hedonistic rachet___.

### How we got here

- After getting married, we chose to live in my wife's modest apartment.  Many of our peers were buying houses soon after or even before getting married.
- When the lease was up, we bought a duplex and lived in one unit.  Same note regarding our peers.
- I worked hard at my career and received a promotion while pretty young.  This was a $25K per year promotion.  With respect to our spending, we actively decided to act as if this promotion had not happened.
- Fast-forward a few years and we purchased a modest home while not selling the duplex.  This home was in a rougher part of town, was easy to afford, and was nothing like what our peers were buying or living in.
- This inexpensive house was a built in savings program.  I'd estimate we were three full rungs beneath our peers on the lifestyle ladder.  Partly this was due to my wife's outreach to youth in the neighborhood by way of an afterschool art studio.
- We outgrew this house and purchased a larger home, again without selling the other house.  This home is likely two rungs up, but by this time still a couple rungs or more lower than our peers.
- Throughout this time, we bought two new cars for cash with the intended goal of owning them for at least 10 years.  These were middle of the road, good quality cars that were likely less flashy than many of the cars of our peers.

>  What is a peer here?  Another married couple where one of the spouse's had a similar moderate-to-high paying job in technology.

- All of this set the stage for starting my second business in software.  The first one failed just prior to when I met my wife.  Our lower than standard lifestyle made it possible for me to build up the business and take a very low salary while the business grew.
- I have since sold the business netting many multiples of my average annual salary when I was an employee.

### Conclusion

Committing to living the simple life, in resistance to ___hedonistic rachet___, allowed us to save well more than 10% after tax every year.  By the grace of God, we were able to continue to increase our giving well beyond 10% during these same years.
