#### How can the strategy of going the extra mile help me attain [these goals]({% post_url 2020-09-05-for-what-will-I-settle %})?

__Going the extra mile__ just seems like smart business.  If you exceed expectations, people will want you to provide service to them again and again.  But, there's more to it than that.

#### Definition according to Napolean Hill

__Going the extra mile__ is defined by Hill in his article, ___Habits of Going the Extra Mile___, as _rendering more and better service than that for which one is paid, and giving it in a positive mental attitude_.

Hill identifies several advantages of rendering service in this manner.  First, doing so brings favorable attention onto you.  Second, doing so grants us a solid logical reason for asking for increased compensation.  And third, doing so keeps your conscience clear and bolsters your soul.

In essence, if we __go the extra mile__, we are working, not only for our monetary compensation, but for future good will, access to opportunities, our own education--a far greater payoff in the future.  Others may punch the clock, but we work and serve to see a much better future for all involved.

#### A daily habit:  the power of compounding

The powerful dynamic at play, according to Hill, is this:  __going the extra mile__ as a daily habit (in all areas of life) accrues in a _compounding_ fashion.  Our daily extra given freely and joyfully will compound on itself.  In pursuing my goals, reputations are at stake. Through this diligent, daily, positive approach, we will be preparing to have a great impact.

> 23 Whatever you are doing, work at it with enthusiasm, as to the Lord and not for people, 24 because you know that you will receive your inheritance from the Lord as the reward. Serve the Lord Christ.
