### Let the other person think your idea is his.

Truly letting the other person think my idea is his idea is easily the most difficult technique for me to learn to do well.  Why?  Well, because it involves many of the other principles in Carnegie's _How to Win Friends and Influence People_.  I need to develop the ability to apply these principles in order to set the stage for helping them conclude "their" idea is viable according to my original goal.

These principles are all foundational to getting someone to take on my idea as their own.

- Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
- Be a good listener.  Encourage the other person to talk.
- Become genuinely interest in other people.
- See things from the other person's viewpoint.
- Let the other person do the talking.
- Get the person saying "yes".

Of all of these, I've learned how to be a good listener.  Improvement, of course, is possible.  Using subtle clarifying questions to keep them talking about their own interests will yield information I can use to make small assertions to see what they think.

I can foresee becoming more skilled at these principles.  Planting several facts and then guiding them to a conclusion that is my idea--this is really challenging.

The biggest barrier to any of this working is my strong desire to share what I know __AND__ get credit for knowing it.  I want people to know that I'm smart.  I like having the answer.

### Conclusion

To develop this technique, I need to intentionally attempt to do this in situations with other people.  Just reading about it and hearing others talk about will not suffice.  I'll need to work on picturing that they will benefit if they go in the direction I want them to go.  They'll benefit even more if they see the change as their own.
