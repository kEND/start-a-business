### Conclusion

I am currently without the energy and willpower to choose one and make a real plan that I'll actually implement.  What I will do is ask God to instill within me a true caring for other people and a curiosity that will manifest in good questions that inspire the other person to talk about themselves. 

Lord, help me to become truly interested in the other person.  Help me ask compelling questions and also make small comments and questions to let them know I am listening and interested in them.
