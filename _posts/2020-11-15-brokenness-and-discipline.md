### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 6: Brokenness and Discipline

## Summarize

Nee describes the ways by which the discipline of the Holy Spirit works toward our brokenness.  Consecration is the first step after we've been rescued by Christ.  Consecration is defined and compared to His discipline.  The means of grace are discussed with the discipline of the Holy Spirit declared to be the most important.  Various dealings of the discipline of the Holy Spirit are described.  Will we resist these dealings?  How great is it that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is ___always___ with us, ___always___ working to break us down.

### Our Consecration and His Discipline

Consecration is merely an expression of our unqualified willingness to be categorically in the hands of God.  Offering ourselves fully and willingly into His hands is the _gateway_ to the process of breaking of the outward man.  This process of breaking _is_ the discipline of the Holy Spirit.

| Our Consecration       |   His Discipline   |
|  limited insight       |   unlimited light  |
|  limited understanding |   transcends far beyond our consecration   |
|  us                    |   God              |

God orders our circumstances for our best profit (in breaking) according to His complete (and personal) knowledge of us.

###  Constructive and Destructive

The working of the Holy Spirit in our lives is both constructive and destructive.  He supplies grace to the inward man to grow our faith and He uses external things to come to bear against our outward man.

He knows our ___need___ -- our need to be broken, so the spirit can reign.  He orders our circumstances to allow external events to hammer away at our outward man.  It is foolish for us to rail against our circumstances.  God is aware of them, has ordered them, and is using them in our life.

>  Finally, there comes a time when you realize that you cannot live __by__ yourself and __for__ yourself.  Even in the dimmed light of your understanding, you should come to God and say:  "I consecrate myself to You. Come life or death, I have committed myself totally into Your hands."  This will strengthen the work of the Holy Spirit in your life.

### The Greatest Means of Grace

God begins his work on us and in us as soon as He gets a green light in the form of our consecration.  The means of grace (or growth) are:  teachings, prayer, fellowship, the Word, service, and suffering.  The discipline of the Holy Spirit (suffering) is the most important means of growth because it is the only one that acts on our outward man, breaking it so the spirit can be released.

He will deal with us in various ways.  We may be focused on material things or relationships or our own thoughts or our emotions.  He will deal with us in our will--the decisions we make independent of Him.  The area of our will is huge.  He will lead us to failure after failure in our lives, by our will.  The beginning of defeat of the outward man is when we no longer trust ourself.

The discipline of the Holy Spirit is always with us, always working to break us down.

>  We need to be delivered of all the many present things today, because they are not found in eternity!

The cross is at work in our lives to the extent that we are submitted to His discipline.  The more we are submitted, the more He can work.

## Impact

I enjoyed this chapter.  I believe I understand this chapter.  Father, thank you for the current circumstances in my life.  May you have your way with me.  May you take away any resistance I pose to the Holy Spirit's work in breaking my outward man.

With my dad's condition and my struggle for significance, you know my needs.  You are actively bringing to bear suffering to change me so that You will bear fruit through me!
