### Would it be moral to grade exams, so that all students get a C?

No.  Exams are graded to evaluate the depth of understanding of the student.  The grade is important to the student, so they can know where they are and whether they need to improve.  Other people may care about the grade.  For example, potential employers use the grade as one of the factors in evaluating one hire from another.

The entire purpose for a graded exam is to measure understanding and progress.  If everyone is adjusted so they receive a __C__, then the results are incorrect and the purpose of the graded exam ___cannot be fulfilled___.  This is lying.  Lying is immoral.

### If not, is it moral for the state to redistribute incomes?

Redistributing incomes, by definition, is taking the profits of some to cover the losses of others.  In a free market, profits are a signal to the businessman that he has satisfactorially served his fellow man.  Losses signal others that they are not serving their fellow man.  Change, or go out of business.  When these signals are disrupted, firms fail that should grow and other firms remain in business when they should close.  The customer, necessarily, is served less well than when firms freely compete for his money.

When the state redistributes incomes, it does so by coercion--violence or threat of violence.  This is stealing.  Stealing is immoral.

### Conclusion

It is immoral for the state to redistribute income.
