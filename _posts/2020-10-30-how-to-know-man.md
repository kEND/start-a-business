### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 4: How To Know Man

## Summarize

Nee, when speaking to Christian workers, says that our effectiveness in service is closely tied to our discernment of the other's spiritual condition.  There are two challenges that can come up when we do not spiritually discern the other's condition.  First, we may have an insight or even a Word from the Lord and yet we apply it to each and every person we meet.  Or second, we will not understand the person's real issue.  They say one thing, but spiritually something else is going on.  We need an exact diagnosis.

We must learn __How To Know Man__.

God wants to work through us to be both a diagnostic instrument and a purveyor of healing for those who are hurting within and without the Body of Christ.  His breaking of our outward man is the testing and calibration of his instrument.  When sufficiently broken, we become able, in our spirit, to understand and discern someone's dominant characteristic, be it pride, inflexibility, anger, etc.

The outward man, in its various conditions, taints our spirit.  To purify the spirit, or rather the outpouring from our spirit, the outward man must be dealt with.  We become more useful to God as we receive many breakings in many areas of our lives.

Our spirit is released to the degree of our brokenness.  

How does this occur?  We can learn 10 years of lessons in one year or take twenty or thirty years to learn one year of lessons.  We must __accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit__.  Human cleverness and human emotions DO NOT HELP in the work of ministering to others' in their spiritual condition of need.  We need to receive God's Spirit when given and then go on learning from there.

How does this ministry come about?  To touch a man's spirit, we wait and he talks.  __How__ he talks is the key.  The topic at hand may not match what his underlying spirit is communicating.  Is it "right" with his spirit?  The condition of the spirit is what we aim to discern spiritually.

When we've learned to spiritually discern a man's spiritual condition, we are providing a way for God to work out His purpose through us.

## Impact

What is the impact of this chapter on me?

This chapter was difficult for me.  I understood it easily enough, but couldn't grasp how it was impacting me at the moment.  After a second (or third) read, it has become more clear.  Nee's declarations about the uselessness of human cleverness (or emotions) in ministry work struck close to home.  I'm that clever man.  All too easily I work on spiritual matters using my intellect.  

Oh Lord, may your loving discipline come. May You help me to receive it so your servant can become calibrated and able to assess the spiritual condition in others and provide them, by your Holy Spirit's guidance, a Word from you for their benefit and the advancement of the kingdom!
