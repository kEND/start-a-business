**Why would YouTube remove a video that garnered 5.3 million views in its first day?**

I watched it and if you watch nothing else, you should watch this video in full.

Watch the reposted original [here](https://www.bitchute.com/video/cz4czSHGNQJu/).  If you're short on time, watch the forbidden final 17 minutes.

## The Stage

Accelerated Urgent Care doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi were extensively interviewed by the Bakersfield, CA ABC affiliate on the topic of Covid-19.  They shared scientific data from their own testing and publically available data from several other jurisdictions.  They presented some well-reasoned questions and their conclusions based on their practical expertise in treating sickness. The full interview is informative and presents real data analyzed by professionals.  The full one hour and eight minute video aired on Youtube on the 26th and was taken down on the 28th after...

> “The video went **viral, reaching over 5.46 million views**, and sparked debate over recommendations to lift the shelter-in-place order. Even catching the attention of SPaceX CEO Elon Musk.” - [[abc23]]

## The Video

After the video was pulled by YouTube, I found other copies posted.  Most contained just the first 51 minutes.  I found only one copy of the final 17 minutes and YouTube or the person posting it killed the mic of the doctors, so you could only hear the question and not their answers.  By the time you read this, perhaps a full version is up again on YouTube.

## The Question

Ponder this question.  Why would such a reasoned, thoughtful, scientific response be censored by YouTube?

### disclaimers

1.  YouTube is a private company.  I support their right to allow or deny any content of their choice.  The question still stands.  Why is this so dangerous for regular people to watch?  What motivated them to take this down after it hit 5.3 million views?

2.  I believe that no Pandemic justifies taking away basic human rights.  

3.  I'm interested in Covid-19, the response taken by governments, the response of the people to those actions.  This can overwhelm, but I'm not overwhelmed because I'm ultimately filled with hope in following Jesus. He desires to set things right in our lives.  He will return to set things right in this world.

4.  BitChute allows all sorts of content.  Casual browsing could shock you. :-)
