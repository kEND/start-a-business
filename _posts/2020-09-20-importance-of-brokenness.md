### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 1: The Importance of Brokenness

## Summarize

Nee lays out and defends the importance of brokenness in making our walks with Christ efficacious.  To understand what he means by brokenness, we first must understand how we are constructed as persons by God.  This applies to those who follow Jesus.

> But if indeed our __outward man__ is consumed, yet our __inward man__ is renewed day by day.
>
> &mdash; <cite>2 Cor. 4:16 NKJV</cite>

Upon accepting Christ's gift, we are indwelt by the Holy Spirit.  Our living __spirit__ is the center of our being and this is where the Holy Spirit himself lives.  This is the __inward man__.  The next layer out is the __soul__ with our thoughts, emotions, and will.  This is the __outward man__.  Lastly, the __outermost man__ is our physical __body__ with the five senses.

Like a grain of wheat has a shell and the alabaster box is sealed with precious nard, so we are now precious and amazing and alive in our inner man, our spirit.  God wants to act through us by the direction of his Holy Spirit leading and empowering our spirit to impact brothers and sisters and the lost.  Our inner man, our soul, is the shell and the alabaster box.  Our old ways, our fleshly ways--of thinking, of feeling, of acting, of speaking--hinder the spirit.  The spirit must come out.  To come out, the soul must be broken.

Given this, we can see that believers are in two groups:  unbroken and restricted; and, broken and useful to advance God's will and grow His kingdom.  

> When the breaking of the outer man occurs, our spirit can come forth and we will be enabled to exercise and release our spirit consistently.
>
> &mdash; <cite>page 16</cite>

Regarding the timing of the breaking of our outer man, it is in the Lord's hands.  He seems to give to some a large-scale, sudden breaking followed by gradual breaking and to others, gradual followed by sudden.  We cannot shorten the time of our breaking, this is His work.  But, we can prolong it.  God's amazing grace toward us preserves our free will.  We can choose to go along with His breaking of our outer man by the Cross or we can hinder him.  

Two reasons are prominent in our lack of brokenness.  "First, we live in __darkness__."  We don't recognize the suffering and daily trials as God's very own hand working his loving discipline toward the breaking of our outer man.  "Second, another great hinderance in breaking the outer man is __self-love__."  We love, even secretly, our own thoughts, emotions, words, and actions so much that we will do almost anything to protect against a threat to them.  Self-love is our protecting the outer man.  We don't want to hurt!

> He that loves his life (Grk. __psuche__ -- soul), shall lose it, and he that hates his life (Grk. __psuche__ -- soul) in this world shall keep it to life eternal
>
> &mdash; <cite>John 12:25 NKJV</cite>

Nee says, "We must ask God to take away the heart of self-love....Let us remember that the one reason for all misunderstandings, all fretfulness, all disappointments, is that we secretly love ourselves."

This love drives us to plan a way out, even subconsciously.  We use one or more ways of escape to avoid the breaking of the cross.

## Impact

Where am I in your breaking of my outer man?  Lord, show me how I am hindering You?  Help me offer myself fully into your hands for your will to be done!

I'm in agreement with Nee.  I need to be broken further in my outer man.  Much of this passed calendar year has been a more major breaking than I've experienced in the past.  Surrendering my dreams, surrendering be involved in startups, surrending the desire to know how to deal with my dad.  Surrending the vocational future of my kids.  Surrendering my fear of failing.  So much surrending and more to go.

For me, the best part of this chapter is the clear identification of believers who are able to be used by the Lord (through the release of their now-living spirit) to do His will.  And the clear identification of those who believe and yet remain ineffective for the Lord.  I'm convinced I need further breaking and I'm convinced my brothers and sisters need further (or a first big) breaking to see the Lord use our home church in a mighty way to reach the lost.  We comfort ourselves well.  Can we turn that comfort outward, but have it be led by the Holy Spirit himself and be a work of our living spirit rather than our own fleshly capabilities?  

I'm confident God will have his way with me in this!
