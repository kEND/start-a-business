### Trust is vital!

You will spend effort acquiring your first customers.  Likewise you will pay to replace customers who leave.  If a customer buys from you only once, their sale must pay for your full customer acquistion cost or you go out of business.  As the number of transactions per customer rises, your acquistion costs as a percentage of sales plummets.  You get to stay in business and make a profit.  Turning a satified customer into a repeat customer is gold!

Build trust during your initial contact with a prospect, then throughout the sales process, through the delivery, and after delivery.  Exceed expectations.  Use the techniques in Dale Carnegie's ___How to Win Friends and Influence People___ to build trust through showing genuine interest in your prospect.  Learn to really, really care about them.  Find ways to help them achieve their goals.  Become a ___partner___ in their business.

They will bring you repeat business and new customers through referals.  As an additional bonus, you may discover whole new lines of business while working with them.  How valuable is this?  For a business, this is priceless.

### Conclusion

You may feel the pressure to close a sale right now.  This pressure can manifest in even more self-focus.  To build and grow a successful business, you need to cultivate a focus on the benefit accruing to the other person.  You need them to trust you.  

What do they need to accomplish?  What do they want?  You need to imagine them making their 5th, 10th, and 50th deal with your company.  You need to see the many other customers they will bring to you because they are more than fully satisfied with how you've helped them.  Smile and be determined to serve them well.
