### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 10: Two Very Different Ways

## Summarize

This is Nee's final chapter.  He makes his final points and clarifies a final exhortation.

The first way is what seems right to us.  We work through our own effort to become broken in the outward man.

The second way is God's way.  His way is the only effective way to brokenness.

He describes these ways in terms of receiving help.  Man's way is similar to approaching a teaching with an understanding that you will learn some doctrine.  Listening to the the teaching once, or even twice in order to learn is cool.  Listening a third, fourth, or nth time seems a waste.

Under God's way, with spirit touching spirit, the same passage can be taught again and again.  A clean and fresh interaction, spirit to spirit occurs each time.  This spirit to spirit interaction helps others and builds us up.

Proof of brokenness is this.  You allow the spirit of another to touch your spirit.  The breaking of the outward man is basic to the Body of Christ giving and receiving help.

> It is our responsibility, first to
> - ask God for enough light to recognize the mighty hand of the Holy Spirit, then to
> - submit to it willingly, and finally to
> - acknowledge that whatever He does is His perogative.

We are his masterpiece.  He _paints_ us by depriving us of our pride, self-love, and self-exaltation.  He desires to free our spirit so it can be fully exercised in useful service and receive life fully.

### Two questions come up

1.  Should we stop any self-effort or gesture we see ourselves doing in order to grow?

    Yes.  We can stop every activity of the flesh, but we cannot imitate the Spirit's work.

    For example, I tend to be proud, so I must refuse all pride.  But I should not fabricate humility.
    Again, I am apt to lose my temper, so I should keep it under control.  But I should not pretend gentleness.

    We can deal with the negative, but we cannot build up the positive by way of the flesh.  Instead commit yourself to the Lord.

    > Lord, there is no reason for me to exert my effort to imitate any virtues.  I am trusting You to do the work.

2.  Is there a difference between a natural virtue and a virtue brought forth by the discipline of the Holy Spirit?

    First, natural virtues are independent of the Holy Spirit.  Spirit wrought virtues are under control of the Spirit.  Natural virtues may be a hindrance to the spirit.  For example, a person with natural gentleness may not be able to speak the hard words the Spirit wants him to speak.

    Second, these natural virtues occur only when we are getting what we want, when things are going our way, when we aren't being thwarted in our pursuits.

    Natural virtues exist to build up and support our self-life.

### Final Exhortation

We cannot force the breaking of the outward man.  "We must clearly submit ourselves under the mighty hand of God and simply accept all of God's alloted and necessary dealings."

Don't ask to _be strong_, proclaim I will _be strong_ ___in the Lord!___"

## Impact

Throughout most of the reading of this book, I would wonder to myself and to God--How will this breaking happen?

Lord, you are bringing forth this breaking in me.  I endeavor, by your Spirit, to submit myself fully into your loving hands.  You will do the work necessary to bring forth brokenness and thereby fruitfulness in your servant.
