### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 7: Dividing and Revelation

## Summarize

God desires to _break_ the outward man and then _separate_ it from the inward man--the division of soul and spirit.

> 12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as __the division of soul and spirit__, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
>
> &mdash; <cite>Hebrews 4:12-13 NASB</cite>

The discipline of the Holy Spirit breaks down the outward man.  Dividing our soul from our spirit is accomplished by the Spirit's revelation.

An unmixed, pure spirit is the best tool for God to do His will.  The spirit needs to be released and then not muddied or clouded by our flesh: our thoughts, emotions, and will.  Our natural self is strong.  He will attempt spiritual things even though the spirit isn't involved.  

God must deal with our natural strength and not superficially.  Mixed together we cannot be fully used by God.  Others need to have an encounter with our spirit and God's Spirit.  If mixed, then they will not experience His Spirit fully.

> Lord, break my outer man, but also divide it from my inner man until it is a pure channel for my spirit.

Through the revelation of the Spirit, the powers of our outward man are completely divided from our spirit.  

### How does the living Word divide?

God's Word is __living__....  Have you contacted it deeply enough to experience the life-giving power of God's Word?  How are you responding to what you've read?  Have you had a _living_ response.  "Lord, help me have a ___living___ response to your Word!"

God's Word is __active__....  (or as Nee's translation says:  operative)  It has the ability to work on man.  It operates on us until it produces results.  

God's Word penetrates and divides....  It discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart.  On what do we deliberate?  What are our motives? 

Nee describes the glib, "oh, it's my flesh" versus that deep, stricken moment when God's light shines and we see the true darkness of self and pride.  Often (always?) our thoughts originate from our flesh and our intentions are entirely selfish.  

> Once you assumed that your thoughts and intentions were of the Lord.

His Word, His revelation, shines this bright piercing light and we see clearly how selfish we are.

This cannot be done in the flesh.  Deliverance comes from the light of God.  He divides the soul and the spirit by revealing __each__ thought, making bare __each__ intention behind that thought, word, or deed.  In His Word we can truly ___see___!

### Revelation?

Revelation enables us to see what God sees.  ALL is naked and bare before Him.  The coverings are revealed as pride.  He helps us to see ourselves as He sees us.

This is difficult to describe.  It takes the light of the Word.  "Oh God!  I am absolutely unreliable.  In my darkness, I do not know what I should denounce, no what sin I should confess.  Only in Your light am I able to know what to do."  He pierces us deeply.

## Impact

Allow yourself to be pierced!  May the Lord open our eyes to the importance of both His discipline and His enlightment by revelation.  "I'm blind and deceived. Lord be merciful!"

I've been regularly praying and journaling and reading the Word.  However, through the reading of this chapter, I've realized that I, all too frequently, do not have a deep connection with the Word, seeking a life-giving response.  Is my phone bible app getting in the way?

"Lord, help me have a ___living___ response to your Word!"
