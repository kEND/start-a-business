### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 9: Meekness in Brokenness

## Summarize

How can we gauge brokenness?  God will bring forth meekness through our brokenness.

Various targets exist for God's breaking action on our flesh:  self-love, pride, self-reliance, cleverness, subjective feelings, etc.  God's method of breaking us depends on what area he is targeting.  For example, the clever brother thinks he can tackle any problem and fix it by means of his cleverness.  The Holy Spirit brings failure into his life.  That which was easy falls apart.

In the Holy Spirit's discipline, God targets an area in our lives and with a certain tempo.  Blows come swiftly one after another or with periods of lulls.  His aim is to weaken us in our strength (self).  Here is the money quote:

> We are naturally obstinate.  This hard, inflexible will is supported by our strong thoughts, opinions, self-love, affections, or cleverness.  This explains the variations in the Holy Spirit's dealings with us.  In the final analysis, __God is after our will__, for it is this which represents the self.

Meekness is a sign of brokenness.  Therefore, a common marker of God's work in breaking us is meekness.  We become able to __recognize true meekness__, not just superficial soft-spokenness.

### Qualities of Meekness

1.  Easily Approachable
    - open for fellowship or contact, 
    - confesses sins and sheds tears freely,
    - open to the opinions of others, and
    - receptive to edification.

2.  Highly Sensitive
    - spiritually alert,
    - aware of the spirit of the other  (e.g. "Stop your praying!!"), and
    - responsive to the Spirit and the other's spirit.

3.  Mutually Corporate
    - in touch with the spirit of the body of Christ,
    - make mistakes, but are quickly pricked in our spirit and confess and repent; and
    - work well together.

4.  Spiritually Receptive
    - fully broken so we can freely receive a life supply from other members of the body, e.g. brilliant and unbroken, we can only hear from those more brilliant then we are;
    - presentation and pronounciation are no longer a focus.  Rather, God's Word reaches our spirit to do Its work.
    - "The measure of help we can receive from others depends upon the openness of our spirit."

Spiritual edification is ___not___ growing in thought and understanding.  It occurs when our spirit has more fresh contact with God's Spirit.  Whatever proceeds from a released spirit brightens everything it reaches.

Why is receiving help is difficult?  Because our outerman is not broken.  No meekness is present.

## Impact

Father, I know that I do not know what to do.  I recognize that You are breaking me--chipping away at my clay outer covering so Your light can shine forth.

Much more work is needed.  I am impatient still, especially with my dad!  Oh Lord may you have your way with me!
