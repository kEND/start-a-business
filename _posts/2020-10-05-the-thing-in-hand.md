### Book & Chapter

- ___The Release of The Spirit___ by Watchman Nee
- Chapter 3: Recognizing "The Thing In Hand"

## Summarize

>  As long as the outward man remains unbroken, we shall most likely find our hands full of things.  Our outward man has its own religious activities, recreational diversions, business concerns, and other side-interests. So when the Spirit of God moves in our spirit, our outward man cannot answer God's call.  Thus, it is the "thing in hand" which blocks the way to spiritual usefulness.

Regarding the things in hand, Nee refers to the reality that our outward man has limited strength.  Whether physical, mental, or emotional, we can only do so much out of our own strength.  He advocates strongly for a breaking of the outward man so that the outward man will have "empty hands" and be of ready use by our spirit as led by the Holy Spirit.

God doesn't override our free will.  He loves us.  His Spirit doesn't circumvent our spirit.  In the same way, our spirit cannot circumvent the outward man.  To impact others, the Holy Spirit and our spirit must work through our will, our thoughts, and our emotions (and our physical body).  

With "things in hand", the outward man will become exhausted, unable to be used by our spirit.  What is the cure?  A breaking of the outward man.

> To break our will, God must __strike__ us with a heavy blow...

until we prostrate ourselves befor Him and say, 

> "I dare not think, I dare not ask, I dare not decide on my own.  In each and every thing I need You!"  In being thus stricken, we learn that our will is __not to act__ independently of God.  Only then is our will ready to be used by the inward man.

Brokenness gives the inner man a pliable will, mind, and emotions.  God wants our spirit to use our outward man for deciding, for thinking, and for loving.

Instead of praying for blessings or relief from our circumstances we can confess to Him that we are His to deal with fully.  That we trust his hand upon us.  That obeying him will lead to brokenness of the outward man and therein blessing.

## Impact

What is the impact of this chapter on me?

I know that the Lord is working through this time with my dad toward my brokenness.  This chapter is powerful.  I have many things in my hands and many more things I could pick up when one of the things in my hands fails to deliver.  I can say that going back to the world for a full time job or career in start-ups is no longer appealing.  He may need to do this more, but I feel that he has broken me of the desire to be validated as important by earning a salary or stimulated by building into a new start-up.

The key impact is silence.  My outward man is rarely ever silent before the Lord.  I need to be broken so I will listen to the Holy Spirit in His wise guidance for my life.  My outward man is constantly taking in new ideas and thinking, thinking, thinking.  I have a rush of life and ideas.  Lord, break my outward man and fill this need from input from within, from your Spirit to my spirit.
