## Principle of Service

Jesus gave the most direct definition of service in Matthew 22:38, "'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" Harry Browne, in his excellent book ___The Secret of Selling Anything___, identifies the determined focus on satisfying the needs or desires of someone else as the key factor in successful selling.  In essence, Browne is uncovering a deep truth, _fully desire and work toward the good of another and you will succeed_.

We'll see below how each of the five steps in Browne's sales process relies upon the principle of service, ___help them get what they want___.

## Foundations in economic law

Rather than appeal to the Bible, Browne builds up the foundation of his sales process using solid economic principles.  First, human beings take action to improve their situation.  We subjectively value what we want against what we already have.  We enter into a trade to gain what we value more in exchange for something we value less.

Both sides of a transaction want to gain in exchange based on their own subjective valuation.  Both the buyer and the seller win in free economic exchange.

If both parties win, we can freely embrace pursuing a win for our sales prospect.  Can we listen to him earnestly so he will share his goals, his motivation?  If we can empathize and understand the challenges that the prospect faces from his perspective, we can help solve his problem.  If we solve his problem, were are serving him and he'll be motived to buy. 

With this in mind, let's look at Browne's sales process.

## Harry Browne's Selling Process
  
  1.  Discover the prospect's motivation

      > then and only then, should you go on to step number two...
      >
      > -- Harry Browne,  ___The Secret of Selling Anything___, page 69, (on [Amazon][browne-selling-anything])
      
      | What is the prospect hoping to accomplish?  When you really understand this and you understand on what basis he will make a decision to buy, you can move on in the sales process.  You need to adopt his mindset, understand what problems he faces, and desire to serve him--to help him win.

  2.  Summarize their motivation and get confirmation
      
      > do not go onto the third step until you've summarized his motivation in such a way as to gain his wholehearted agreement.
      >
      > -- Browne, page 71

      | Browne essentially says, STOP!  If you don't have his problem summarized and defined in terms he understands, you will fail to serve him and therefore fail to get the sale.

  3.  Present your product/service
  
      > Present your product.  Present it solely in terms of the benefits he's told you were important to him.
      >
      > -- Browne, page 79

      "benefits...important to him."  A true servant seeks that which benefits the other.  This is his primary focus.

  4.  Answer questions

      > Always make sure you aren't contradicting your prospect.
      >
      > -- Browne, page 84

      | Use _listen, agree, suggest_ to answer any questions and objections.  Deepen your understanding of how best you can serve him.  Contradicting him puts you at odds with him.  A servant seeks to understand and propose action that will benefit the other.

  5.  Close the sale
      
      > Closing is easy.  It's only difficult when you fall into the trap of thinking of the sales interview as a war of words and nerves between you and the prospect.  If you find out what he wants, and offer him what he wants, why would he ever resent your suggestion that he take advantage of it?
      >
      > -- Browne, page 101

      | Once again, the key is focusing on the needs and wants of the other.  If we can genuinely adopt this attitude and approach, we will be in a position to serve the prospect by suggesting they take advantage of how our product/service will meet their needs.

## Conclusion

_Fully desire and work toward the good of another and you will succeed_.  Genuinely focusing on the needs of the other person and finding ways to meet those needs __is__ serving them.  Browne's entire sales process hinges upon this focus.  Why does this work?  Because both parties benefit in a free market exchange.
