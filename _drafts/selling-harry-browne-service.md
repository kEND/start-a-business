## Principle of Service

Jesus gave the most direct definition of service in Matthew 22:38, "'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" Harry Browne, in his excellent book ___The Secret of Selling Anything___, identifies the determined focus on satisfying the needs or desires of someone else as the key factor in successful selling.  In essence, Browne is uncovering a deep truth, _fully desire and work toward the good of another and you will succeed_.

We'll see below how each of the five steps in Browne's sales process relies upon the principle of service, ___help them get what they want___.

## Foundations in economic law

Rather than appeal to the Bible, Browne builds up the foundation of his sales process using solid economic principles.  First, human beings take action to improve their situation.  We subjectively value what we could have against what we already have.  We will enter into a trade to gain what we value more in exchange for something we value less.

Both sides of a transaction operate with this same motivation and subjective valuation.  Both will proceed with an exchange, gaining something they value more for something they value less.  Both parties gain.

Additionally, money is most desired because it is the most widely marketable commodotity.  All other items trade at a discount, because they are less flexible.  The buyer with money to spend is in the driver's seat.  He can enter the market to get what he wants.

Again, the key is this:  both the buyer and the seller win in free economic exchange.  With this in mind, let's look at Browne's sales process.
