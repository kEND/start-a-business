## The Master Plan Pledge

Okay, Michael.  I am with you.  I have committed to creating a master plan that I can use to succeed this year.  I commit to following that plan without question or complaint.  I further commit to keeping a journal on my progress and investing the time and money needed to achieve my goals.  At the end of the year, I promise I will write to you and explain exactly what I have accomplished.

I hereby pledge to be firmly pursuing my life's calling (post-dementia caregiving) by the will of God throughout this year.

Name:  Ken Barker
