## To my children:  You have a big decision to make...and it's okay!

College.  A college degree.  I cannot tell you whether it is worth it. Given who you are and what you want to do.  I can tell you this.  You need to prepare for a future where you are able to take care of yourselves, be generous with others, and perhaps support a family.  The statistics are solid. A Bachelor's degree earns more than a high school degree by a significant amount.

The statistics also lie.  If you choose the wrong degree, it won't really help you.  If you choose to get the degree and take on a bunch of student loan debt, it will not help, it will hurt you.  

If you are __willing to dare__, you can take steps now to choose a different path.  Determine to start a business.  Determine to learn from failure.  Determine to create a sustainable income.  With it, you can generously bless your family and your friends and the world.

It's okay to not choose to start a business.  You __will__ need to pursue an occupation so you can fulfill your calling.  Your calling is from God and it is your personal, great, life purpose.  Your calling will likely not pay you anything. It will cost you.  You'll be glad to pay because you will be fulfilling God's plan for your life.

A trade is an excellent alternative.  Can you apprentice yourself to a hardworking tradesman, preferably an someone independent?  While learning your trade, why not learn to be a good business person?  

### What will it cost me if I paid for each of you to get your Bachelor's degree

Well, by the grace of God, you have generous family members and have access to ~$100K. Ohio State can cost approximately $125K[^osucost] in-state assuming four years.  If I were an unwise parent, I would chip in and pick up the difference.  That would be ~$75K (three kids) out of my pocket.

### What else could you do with these funds?

You are all very privileged to be in a position to make significant decisions about your own life and how things unfold.  You've heard me talk about the importance of spending education money wisely, i.e. only on degrees that will give you a return on your money.  

Please consider doing anything you can to reduce the cost of college.  You directly benefit from doing so.  Any amount you do not spend can fund the growth of a business.  Much of the college expense is completely unnecessary (even if you conclude you need to get a degree).

### How will I use the funds I've "saved"?

We'll, I'm not really saving anything because it is doubtful that I will be paying anything out-of-pocket for your education.  For argument sake, the ~$75K that we save will likely be two down payments on two single family homes purchased for rental income and appreciation.  Thanks!

### The Bottom Line

__There are smart ways to go.__  A trade, a business, college, or some combination of the three.  ___You___ are in charge.  I believe in you!
