> If you want financial independance, in the sense of not being dependent on a single source of income, not being dependent on a monthly paycheck from a company, then the best way to do this is to start a business.

## Multiple Employers

Restating Dr. North's quote (above), if you have one employer and that employer lets you go, you're screwed.  If you have many employers (clients/customers) and one of them "let's you go", you have many other sources of income __and__, if you're operating well, you'll be adding new "employees" day by day.

## Ride the trend

As a business owner, I will be much closer to the decisions that actors are making in the market.  My motivation will be higher to study trends and predict future trends.  I will be in a position to invest capital and effort into providing services (or products) to the market that harness the trend like a sail harnesses the wind.  

In contrast, being an employee puts you in a state of caring deeply about serving your internal customers: your boss, your team.  You may be insulated from what is happening in the market.

## Flexibility

As an employee, I'm constrained to a certain set of tasks or areas of responsibility.  I'm typically not free to investigate and hypothesize and then test out new offerings to the market (unless that is specifically my job, but then why not have a stake in it!)

As a business owner, my rewards come solely from sastifying the most customers possible in an ongoing relationship.  The world is always changing.  Robotic automation and its software correlate are real trends that are happening now.  The status quo is always being disrupted.  

> How can I take advantage or leverage these trends?  What changes do I need to make today, tomorrow, next month to ensure that I'm in a position to really serve my customers?

A business owner has greater flexibility (and direct motivation) to answer these questions.

## Conclusion

The old way is dead.  The old way is always dying.  The pace of change in the economy is very likely to continue to accelerate.  If I decide today to set up one or more businesses that acknowledge and leverage these trends, I'll be putting myself in a great position.  That is a position with a mindset of being aware of the market, anticipating the market, and adjusting to the new reality ___before___ it arrives.
