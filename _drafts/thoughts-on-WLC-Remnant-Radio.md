## Remnant Radio

They quick pinpoint two questions: 

- how should we interpret Gen 1-3?  The Hermeneutical Question

- what does science say about the beginning of humankind?

### My initial thoughts

Craig pins a lot or all of his interpretation of Gen 1-3 on it being mytho-historical (genre).  He uses this term from other sources and quickly has to help the modern lay listener understand that it is not myth in the sense that we use the term today, i.e. fiction.

On the one hand some of this makes sense to me, specifically if the opposing view is straight literalism.  I guess I wanting to know more about what mytho-history is and isn't.  

Perhaps this is overly simplistic.  I believe Gen 1-3 are an accurate account of what God did distilled into a verbally transferrable historic narative.  Imagine telling a 1st grade class about World War II.  It is possible to share facts and a timeline with them so they will understand some major themes.  No one would pretend that it was an exhaustive treatise on the causes and events and consequences of WWII.

### Questions

- Cheribim?  Is this commonly held?  Isn't a better explanation that these are real angelic beings?  How does he know they don't exist?  The OT prohibits ALL image making???  

- Neanderthal and Homosapien with a common ancestor.  I do see why God couldn't have done it this way.  Is dust dirt or could it be matter, physical matter, genetic material?

- "Let us make man in our image..."  To say the early listeners wouldn't understand this as trinitarian is fine.  No one knew what the trinity was.  To say that it isn't trinitarian is too much.  God reveals himself through scripture and not fully and not all at once.

- snake isn't satan?  isn't God's enemy?  Just in the plain reading of Gen 1-3, which character accuses God?

- Innerrancy.  They didn't discuss this much on the podcast.  I imagine Craig would hold to the innerrancy of the bible and simply put all of this under a desire to interpret it correctly. ???

## James Rochford video response

Note this is not a response only to the Remnant Radio interview, but rather Craig's views on Genesis from the interview and his classes and other materials.

- Mytho-historical genre definition is so broad as to exclude no ancient writings
- Craig seems to be making things more complex rather than making things more clear when he tries to describe Mytho-History of Genesis.
- Under his view, how do you know when to interpret figuratively or metaphorically versus literally?
- His view is cryptic and vague with no interpretive boundaries.
- Eridu Genesis and Hebrew Genesis comparison is very weak.  Superficial similarities, many contractictions, with 40% of the text of Eridu Genesis missing.
- Etiologies exist beyond Gen 1-11.  How does he know when to apply this etiological argument to determine mytho-historical genre?
- Theophanies?  His key point.  Many other times outside of Gen 1-11.
- Use of rhetoric not characteristic of his prior argumentation.  "CPR","floating rib"  Set's up YEC as the only other viable interpretation and then, suprisingly (not!), prefers his mytho-historical genre view.
