### BAM Mini-Pitch

If God wills it, I'll be running a software development consultancy providing offshore project-based services to US companies based in a significant 2nd or 3rd world city.  This will be a business as a mission, BAM.  We will recruit local university talent to work for and learn in the company that provides for their families.  We will bring the life of Jesus into their lives and, by the grace of God, see some of them won into the Kingdom as solid disciples of Christ.  Likewise, Julie and I will provide member care for missionaries and their families in the surrounding region.

#### Main USP

We will provide cross-culturally aware, quality software development services to US companies at a significant cost savings over US based developers.

#### Marketing & Sales

A combination of leveraging my network, a focus on specific technology stacks, and contributions to open source projects and conference speaking.

Initially, and until we're bigger, I'll be handling the sales process.

#### Recruiting

Heavy involvement, perhaps as an instructor, at the local university will bring our company into contact with potential workers.

#### Capital

This should be a fairly low capital investment business.  Very little capital is required to start this type of services business.  Working capital to cover the initial Accounts Receivable lag is the primary capital requirement.

#### Mission

A profitable business employing and training locals gives us a reason to be in our host country.  From that foundation, Julie and I will provide member care to missionaries and their families.  This may take the form or respite retreats, frequent discipleship/counseling, and/or assistance in language training or in obtaining and extending visas, etc.
