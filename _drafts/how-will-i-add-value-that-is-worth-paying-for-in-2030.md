  3.  Develop software tools that overlay solid business principles and modern marketing and customer service to local service workers.
      - Harness the skills of local service workers (e.g. plumbers)
      - provide modern marketing and business accumen.  Their clients expect it and they don't want to provide it.  Help them provide it and take a cut of every transaction.
